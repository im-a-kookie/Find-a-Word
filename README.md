# FindaWord

A really simple console application for making word search puzzles. There may be bugs, as this is a proof of concept that has not been rigorously tested.

Essentially, the algorithm takes a given set of words, then generates a word search puzzle from those words. The remaining spaces are filled exclusively with the letters of these words, but in such a way that no additional words will be formed, resulting in puzzles that will, quote; "make your eyes bleed."

An example puzzle can be found [here](FindaWord/Resources/Puzzle.png).

Simple CLI usage.

Inspired by a social media post, where the poster lamented the difficulty of creating such puzzles manually.
