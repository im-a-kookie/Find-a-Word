# FindaWord

A really simple console application for making word search puzzles.

Might have a few bugs, haven't rigorously tested it, probably not suuuper robust. It may freeze if given a poor set of letters, but it's unlikely.

Essentially: takes a given list of words, then creates a word search using those words and no other letters. In theory, this should also create no additional words when filling the grid, though I found this to be somewhat impractical when eliminating words of 3 or less letters.

Simple CLI usage.

Inspired by a reddit post about eye-bleedy word search puzzles, so I made a thing.
